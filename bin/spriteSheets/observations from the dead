did the calcs
from strides to frames to fps to px 
which gave a number (real) which multiplied by a multiplier
gave the movemnet speed



did calcs for megaman (3 frame)
	slow, but animation looked like it made sense
	changed (real), but still looked ok? maybe cuz too simple


without changing any nums, same for samus (10)
	even slower, but animation still made sense <- this was tinkered real, 0.75 not 0.43
	0.43 (megaReal) looked on the edge of okay/not okay. now it seemed too slow
	to the point where the anim didnt make sense anymore
	
	
	samusReal (0.37) looks okay..till the end. rounding erros?
	math erros?
	arrows?
	doubling to 0.75 looks gud
	
	
guess what im a dumbass :)

update was tiedu p with animupdate so big boo

now it looks okay..but how mult work now
